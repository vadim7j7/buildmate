# /recap — Session Recap

Gathers all available context about work in progress and presents a clear
"here's where you left off" summary so you can continue without losing momentum.

## When to Use

- At the start of a new session
- After the session-load hook shows stale context
- When you want to review the full state of the project

## What It Checks

1. **Active work context** — `.claude/context/active-work.md` (auto-saved by session-save hook)
2. **Session summary** — `.claude/context/session-summary.md` (generated by session-end hook)
3. **Activity log** — `.claude/context/agent-activity.log` (recent file changes and task completions)
4. **In-progress features** — All feature files in `.claude/context/features/` with status `in-progress`
5. **Git state** — Current branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits
6. **Pipeline state** — `.agent-pipeline/pipeline.json` if an agent pipeline was running
7. **Eval results** — Latest eval report in `.agent-eval-results/` if any

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Session Context Files

Read the saved session context:

```bash
cat .claude/context/active-work.md
cat .claude/context/session-summary.md
tail -30 .claude/context/agent-activity.log
```

From these files, note:
- When the last session ended
- What files were edited
- What tasks were completed
- Current branch and uncommitted changes

### Step 2: Scan Feature Files

Read all files in `.claude/context/features/`. For each file:
- Extract the title (first `#` heading)
- Extract the status line
- If status is `in-progress`, `testing`, or `review`, list the remaining unchecked tasks

### Step 3: Check Git State

Run these commands to understand the current code state:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log --oneline -5
```

Note:
- What branch you're on
- Whether there are uncommitted changes
- What the recent commits were about

### Step 4: Check Pipeline State

If `.agent-pipeline/pipeline.json` exists:

```bash
cat .agent-pipeline/pipeline.json
```

Report which stages completed, which failed, and which are pending.

### Step 5: Check Latest Eval Results

Look for the most recent eval report:

```bash
ls -t .agent-eval-results/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

If found, read it and report the overall score and any NEEDS_FIXES items.

## Output Format

Present the findings as a structured summary:

```markdown
## Session Recap

### Last Session
- **Ended:** <timestamp from session-summary.md>
- **Branch:** <branch name>
- **Files edited:** <count>
- **Tasks completed:** <count>

### Recent Activity
<last 5-10 entries from agent-activity.log>

### In-Progress Features
1. **<Feature Title>** — <status>
   - Remaining: <count> tasks
   - Next task: <first unchecked item>

### Current Code State
- **Branch:** `<branch>`
- **Uncommitted changes:** <count> files modified
- **Recent commits:** <1-line summary of last 2-3 commits>

### Pipeline Status
- <stage>: <status> (or "No active pipeline")

### Suggested Next Steps
1. <most logical next action based on context>
2. <second action>
```

## Key Rules

1. **Read, don't guess.** Only report information from actual files and git state.
2. **Be concise.** The user wants to quickly orient themselves, not read an essay.
3. **Suggest next steps.** Based on the state, recommend what to do next.
4. **Don't modify anything.** This skill is read-only. It never writes files or runs commands that change state.
